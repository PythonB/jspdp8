### Adition on teletype emulation

Overprinting is a nice feature, but due to complications with writing own text rendering engine to simulate this process I deided to sacrifice this feature.

### Emulation of file sources

Emulation of file sources is planned, and final goal is to achieve OS-8 up and running.
